I am an Arizona native, with a current focus on blockchain and DApp development, blockchain analytics, and decentalization (particularly DAOs).
            </p>

            <p>
The main focus with this site is to encourage me to push my work into the world, as well as to help any other people beginning their journey into the cryptosphere. 
            </p>
            <p>
The bulk of my programming experience has been with Python and SQL (Redshift and Postgres) for the purpose of business intelligence and statistical learning (aka ML).

I have taken a brief sabbatical from my previous position to allow me the time to delve further into the world of Web3 and position myself to join this young industry whether as a founder or as an employee/contributor of a promising project. This has involved learning the basics of web development (yoohoo for a site built by myself in React using Typescript!) and smart contract development in Solidity while also looking further into the use cases of Web3. 
            </p>
            <p>
In my free time I am an active cryptocurrency trader (alt swings and early investment typically), a backpacker, a hiker, a loving partner, and an avid reader.
